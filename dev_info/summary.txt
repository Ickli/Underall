SYSTEMS CHANGES DUE TO CHANGED SAVE_INFO/LEVEL_INFO
- [semi-done] SPhysics should now work only for entities contained inside grid
- WorldGrid should not be reinitialized after each go-out-of-sight of controllable:
    because grids are going to be bigger than screen, so only screen position have to be updated
    and - if and only if controllable go out of grid - the grid must be reinitialized
GUI/GRAPHICS
5. Study SpriteBatch's work (maybe i'll be able to throw away WorldGrid's LayeredGrid)
6. Rewrite GUI's StatBar
7. Place all GUI to its own configuration file
8. Study HLSL and try to write light-sphere shaders
